/*
The fan-out/fan-in pattern involves distributing tasks to multiple worker goroutines (fan-out)
and then aggregating their results (fan-in).
Itâ€™s useful for parallelizing tasks and combining their outcomes.
Application:
1. Web scraping multiple websites concurrently and merging the results.
2. Aggregating data from multiple sensors in IoT applications.
